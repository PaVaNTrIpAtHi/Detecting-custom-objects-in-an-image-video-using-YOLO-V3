# Detecting-custom-objects-in-an-image-video-using-YOLO-V3
YOLO is the state of the art and industry used algorithm for object detection these days. This does the classification/detection by creating grids in the whole image and achieves high accuracy at a very good speed and in real time. We use a pre-trained model which has been trained on the COCO dataset and performs object detection which a very high degree of accuracy.
